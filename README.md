## Contextual Representation of Text (conrep-text)

Recursive Linear Transformer (RLT or rlt) is an algorithm for representation of text's context as a low dimensional dense vector.

It takes word embedding and text's parsed information as the inputs and produces the context embedding vector for respective text.

The dimension of the context embedding is equal to the dimension of the word embedding fed as an input.
